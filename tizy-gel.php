                        <h4>PRODUCT INTRODUCTION</h4>
                        <p>Tizy Gel is an eye lubricant or artificial tears used to relieve dry eyes. This can happen because not enough tears are made to keep the eye lubricated. It helps to soothe the irritation and burning seen in dry eyes by maintaining proper lubrication of the eyes.</p>
                        <p> Tizy Gel is usually taken when needed. Use the number of drops as advised by your doctor. Wait for at least 5-10 minutes before delivering any other medication in the same eye to avoid dilution. Do not use a bottle if the seal is broken before you open it. Always wash your hands and do not touch the end of the dropper. This could infect your eye. This medicine may require long-term use and can be taken safely for as long as you need it. </p>
                        <p>The most common side effects of using this medicine are blurred or altered vision, and sometimes pain in the eye. Let your doctor know if you experience these symptoms but they are usually temporary. Do not drive, use machinery, or do any activity that requires clear vision until you are sure you can do it safely. Consult your doctor if your condition does not improve or if the side effects bother you. </p>
                        <p>This medicine is not likely to affect or be affected by other medicines you use but tell your doctor if you have ever had glaucoma. Do not use it while wearing soft contact lenses and talk to your doctor if you develop an eye infection while using it</p>

                        <h6>• BENEFITS OF TIZY EYE GEL</h6>
                        <p>Normally your eyes produce enough natural tears to help them move easily and comfortably and to remove dust and other particles. If they do not produce enough tears, they can become dry, red and painful. Dry eyes can be caused by wind, sun, heating, computer use, and some medications. Tizy Gel keeps your eyes lubricated and can relieve any dryness and pain. They will also help protect your eyes from injury and infection.</p>
